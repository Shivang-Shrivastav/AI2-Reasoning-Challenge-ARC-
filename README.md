What is ARC Challenge?

The AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) dataset comprises 7,787 authentic, grade-school level, multiple-choice science questions that are intended for question-answering. The dataset is divided into two subsets: the Challenge Set and the Easy Set. 

The Challenge Set is composed solely of questions that were answered incorrectly by both a retrieval-based algorithm and a word co-occurrence algorithm. The models are assessed based on their accuracy, and the goal is to provide a benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) reasoning capabilities. 

This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and developers interested in natural language processing and AI reasoning. The ARC dataset's significance stems from its capacity to evaluate and compare models that exhibit human-like intelligence in a variety of scenarios, making it a crucial tool for advancing the field of AI.

In addition to the questions, the dataset also includes a corpus of over 14 million science sentences relevant to the task.
